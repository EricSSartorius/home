6 months ago I wrote an article with a 6-month breakdown of my spending to show [how I cut spending by traveling](/posts/how-i-save-money-by-traveling-the-world). Another 6 months have passed so I thought I would compare it to the first 6 and show how much I spent after a full year of traveling around the world. The following estimates are for essentials accommodations, transportation & food.

**A few things to keep in mind:**

*   _To keep all of my estimates at an even 6 months, I will list what I have spent between January 22nd, 2017 and June 21st, 2017._
*   _Estimates for public transportation and food are rough calculations._
*   _These estimates do not include things such as entertainment, clothing purchases(which I rarely have anyways), cell phone bills, etc.. In reality, I spend more than this._

## Accommodations

The first 6 months of my journey, I went to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Australia. I was lucky that I had many friends to help house me for cheap and bring my 6-month accommodation spending to **$800**. I wasn't able to get my accommodation costs quite as low this past 6 months but I still did a good job. I owe a lot to wonderful friends that helped me out with places to sleep during my journey. [Airbnb](http://www.airbnb.com.au/c/erics20340) also worked out very well and I found a couple great places at a good price.

##### My accommodation breakdown:

**Melbourne, Australia:**  $0 for 1 month (amount paid included from first 6-month breakdown)

**Mauritius:** $400 for 1 month

**Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam:**  $17 for 10 days

**Niigata, Tokyo, Osaka & Shiga, Japan:**  _$193_ for 5 weeks

**Seoul, South Korea:** _$300_ for 9 weeks

## Transportation

I proved in my article about the first 6 months of my travels that globetrotting does not have to be expensive. After constantly tracking airplane prices, I was able to snag a few good deals along with a business trip that got me a free flight. Compared to my first 6 months of transportation costs (**$2905**), this time around I cut my spending on transportation in about half! I highly recommend [Google Flights](http://www.google.com/flights) if you are trying to track flight prices and waiting for that right moment to book a flight.

##### My airplane breakdown:

**Australia -> Mauritius:** $390

**Mauritius -> Vietnam:** $280

**Vietnam -> Japan:** $0

**Japan -> Korea:** $85

##### My public transport breakdown:

**Melbourne, Australia:**  $80 for 1 month

**Mauritius:** $100 for 1 month

**Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam:**  $50 for 10 days

**Niigata, Tokyo, Osaka & Shiga, Japan:**  _$350_ for 5 weeks

**Seoul, South Korea:** _$170_ for 9 weeks

*Note: my transportation spending for Vietnam should have been closer to about 20 dollars [if it wasn't for getting ripped off by a taxi driver](/posts/swindled-by-a-taxi-driver-my-first-night-in-vietnam/)

## Food

Just a disclaimer, this category is the most difficult to calculate so the estimates are rather on the rough side. My first 6-month breakdown for food was calculated at **$3,540**. Most of my time then was spent in countries that were a bit more expensive and I didn't do much cooking. This past 6 months I brought my spending down quite a lot by traveling to cheaper countries and trying hard to cook more and eat healthy (I lost about 5 kilos in the past few months).

##### My food breakdown:

**Australia:**  $350 for 1 month

**Mauritius:** $300 for 1 month

**Vietnam:**  $50 for 10 days

**Japan:**  _$500_ for 5 weeks

**South Korea:** _$1300_ for 9 weeks

## Conclusion

In my first article on [how I save money by traveling](/posts/how-i-save-money-by-traveling-the-world), I compared how much I would have spent living at home in the US vs how much I actually spent by traveling. I estimated that essentials for 6 months at home would have cost me around **$12,380** but by traveling I only spent about **$7,245**. This time around I am comparing the most recent 6 months of my travels to the first 6 months and found out I was able to bring my spending down even more.

##### The first 6 months living overseas (6/21/2016 - 1/21/2017):

*   **Accommodations: $800**
*   **Transportation: $2,905**
*   **Food: $3,540**

##### **Total: <u>$7,245</u>**

##### The past 6 months living overseas (1/22/2017 - 6/21/2017):

*   **Accommodations: $910**
*   **Transportation: $1,505**
*   **Food: $2,500**

##### **Total: <u>$4,915</u>**

That means my total essentials spending for the past year was **$12,160**! That is basically the same as my estimate for 6 months of living at home. So according to my (rough) calculations, By traveling the world this past year I saved about $12,600!
