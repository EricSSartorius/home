				<h3>Web Development And UI/UX Design</h3>
				<p>
					I have over a decade of experience with web development and design, and helping startups
					go from idea to Saas product. I currently own a web development agency called <a
						href="https://purefunc.io"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">Pure Func</a
					> for anyone looking to get a startup off the ground.

				<h3>Digital Nomad</h3>
				<p>
					Life is short and I want to see how much I can explore and learn before I die! If you are
					curious about my world travels check out my <a href="/posts/">travel blog.</a>

				<h3>Translation</h3>
				<p>
					After studying abroad in Japan in 2004, I realized I had a passion for learning languages.
					I then went on to major in Japanese, live in Japan for 4 years, and then move to Korea for
					6 years and learn Korean. During my time abroad, I had many opportunities to do freelance
					translation, interpretation, and subtitling work.

				<h3>Movement Coach</h3>
				<p>
					I am now into my 40s yet never seemed to have outgrown my days at the playground. I have
					over 20 years experience in breakdancing, 10 years in calisthenics training, as well as
					experience in Capoeira, acrobatics, stunt work, pole dancing, boxing, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu,
					tricking, gymnastics, and parkour. I would love to help anyone else that wants to test the
					limits of their body and move like they never have before.
